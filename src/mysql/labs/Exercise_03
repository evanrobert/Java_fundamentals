*  MySQL Exercise 3:
*
*   Now that you have your air travel database all set up and populated, please demonstrate how to:
*
*       1.) Query all flights on a specific day
        SELECT * FROM tickets where departuredate = "2018-01-01";
*       2.) Query all flights between two specific cities on a specific day
        SELECT starting_locationid, destination_locationid FROM airtravel.flights;
*       3.) Query all passengers on a specific flight between two specific cities today
        SELECT  destination_locationid, starting_locationid, passenger_id FROM airtravel.flights WHERE starting_locationid NOT LIKE destination_locationid;

*       4.) Query the flight information for a specific passenger on a specific flight
        SELECT p.first_name, p.last_name, f.destination_locationid, f.departure,f.arrival, f.flightid, f.starting_locationid
        FROM passengers p
        JOIN flights f
        ON p.passengerid = f.passenger_id;
*       5.) Query the passenger information for a specific user on a specific flight yesterday
        SELECT  p.first_name,p.last_name,p.state, f.starting_locationid, f.destination_locationid,f.arrival,f.departure
        FROM passengers p
        JOIN flights f
        ON p.passengerid = f.flightid
        WHERE departure = "2022-12-24";
*       6.) Query the number of flights between two specific cities this week, month, and year
SELECT * FROM airtravel.flights where  flights.destination_locationid = "MIN";
*       7.) Query the number of passengers that travelled between two specific cities today, this week, month and year
        SELECT  passengers.first_name, passengers.last_name, flights.destination_locationid, flights.starting_locationid, flights.departure,flights.arrival
        FROM passengers
        JOIN flights
        ON passengerid = flightid
        WHERE flights.starting_locationid = "SEA";

*       8.) Insert records for new flights between airports
INSERT INTO flights (arrival, departure,starting_locationid,destination_locationid,passenger_id)
VALUES ("2021-12-12","21-12-11","NYC","SEA",22);
*       9.) Insert records for new tickets and passengers on specific flights
INSERT INTO passengers (first_name, Last_name,address,city,state,country,zipcode)
VALUES ("steve", "stevenson","22144","lincon city"," Oregon","US","42751");
*       10.) Update meal preference (or something similar) for a specific passenger on a specific flight
SELECT meals.mealprice, meals.snackprice, passengers.first_name,passengers.last_name
from meals
Join passengers
On passengers.passengerid= meals.customer_id
WHERE meals.mealprice > 0;
*       Bonus: Have some fun - get creative - what else can you do? Flex those SQL muscles and show us what
*           you've got! :)
